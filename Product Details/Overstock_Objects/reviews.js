      "I got this cart to add more working space to my small galley kitchen. Went together very easily in a few hours. It added a lot of storage space too - in the cabinet part I was able to put bread machine, rice cooker, toaster, dog food, small mixer and immersion blender",

      "Functionality: If you don't mind chips, scratches, and flaws on a piece that is still functional, then perhaps you won't mind this item. It is still newly assembled in my kitchen. Thus far it has been functional, for the most part.",

      "Don't do it. I know this cabinet looks cute, and it seems like a good price for real wood. And maybe like me you are very experienced with assembling furniture, that's why I ignored the negative comments",

      "I ordered this lazy susan to organize my spices, it didn’t initially fit well until I raised the shelf above it, so be sure to check height and take into account the height of what you plan to put on top over all I’m very happy with this product!",
